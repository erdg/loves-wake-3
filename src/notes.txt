- date picker component!!!


- chronicle items each need unique url


- chronicle items need user (creator) associated with them


- store/index.js should be split into several files
   - keep store only stuff in
   - fetch calls and api details to another file


- add item experience
   - what does the FAB expand into?
      - likely a little modal... would you like to:
         - add a single card?
            - existing add card screen
         - upload a bunch of media?
         - share a story? (this is mostly the same as the first option,
           but maybe the distinction is helpful


- function choose a new 64bit urlStr?
   - try to filter, sometimes you get weird shit
      - '/memorial/Hkaasw0w/RandyRandleman' lol, ass-wow!
   - this would allow to reset the memorial 'password' in a sense, if we
     go with the share a signup url


- edit item experience


- onboarding experience
   - submits sign up form
   - lands on profile page
   - "did you come here to create a memorial or contribute to an
     existing memorial?"
   - create
      - begin create memorial experience
   - contribute
      - figure out which memorial
      - request join/access to contribute
      - ideally, if person followed link to sign up (contribute),
        learned about it from an invitation, we should know which 
        memorial they are going to contribute to.
      - show how to contribute (contributor tour?)


- invitations
   - email invite
   - text message invite
      - copy and paste from create invitation workflow
   - have link to signup in invitation?
      - link is something like '/signup/urlStr/urlNm'
         - if they visit the extended signup url (above) and their email
           is on the list of contributors for that memorial, they are
           automatically subscribed and given contrib permissions
      - send out link with optional password?


- solidify create memorial exp
   - name, birth, death. done.
   - route to MemorialView
   - show how to add content
      - create, edit, and delete first card
      - batch photo (media) imports
   - show how to invite others
   - show how to moderate content
      - edit
      - delete
      - show/hide content for public view
      - remove contributors


- landing page exp
   - tour a memorial?


- is it reasonable to expect every person that is invited to contribute
  to create an account before contributing?
   - unless I was really close to the person, i would probably say eh,
      nah.
   - but maybe that's not a thing? do people outside of hackernews have
      as much pushback at the idea of (rather) spontaneously joining new
      services
   - several solutions to shrine privacy
      - shrine has a contributor password
         - anyone that visits can click fab
         - prompted for password
         - if correct, can post to shrine
            - how to attribute card to creator?
               - ask for name?
      - shrine has list of email addresses that can post
         - prompted for email, if valid can submit
            - card is at least associated with an email address
            - can ask for name, too



Refactoring
===========
- move more state to store


- move things 'up'
   - e.g. right now 'ChronicleAddItemModal' is a child of
     'ChronicleSpeedDial' (which isn't even a speed dial anymore)
   - same with 'ChronicleEditItemModal' (see below)
   - I think almost all state/app logic should be contained in the
     store. This allows for more "surgical" precision with props, rather
     than passing props through a bunch of different layers. I think
     that the react documentation suggests just passing them a couple of
     layers if that's all the deeper you have to go, but I really
     dislike doing that.


- move 'MemorialTabs' to header, so it's all one 'Headroom' component


- edit cards are a mess
   - maybe have 'currentlyEditedItem' as state in store?
   - or just 'currentItem' as state?
   - ChronicleEditItemModal is a child of Chronicle card
      - should just be a (mostly hidden) child of Memorial
